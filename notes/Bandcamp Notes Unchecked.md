# Bandcamp Was music streaming’s hero, all along

Bandcamp has been your streaming salvation since the beginning

----------

*Extratone* principally began as an effort to build a “platform” for a specific community of independent electronic musicians and friends whose culture of expression remained *so* centrally unique that I eventually found myself wanting little else but to amplify them as much as possible. Embarrassingly, the solution couldn’t have been more obviously riveted to the tip of my nose, but it wasn’t until I re-submerged headfirst into online music communities in the spirit of re-versing myself for this essay, running down every fleeting interview with Bandcamp’s core executives, and catching myself up with their rapidly-developing Editorial voice that I realized how closely parallel our end goals ran us. I put off writing about Bandcamp for a long time, but when I finally began work on this essay in the Spring, I (and myself,) throughout the entirety of our creative lives – one of only a handful of true constants. There is no more pertinent way to introduce this new featured vertical of ours in preparation for our upcoming relaunch as an Electronic Music Magazine than with the story of the music industry’s efforts to duplicate and maintain its ancient & terrible power across the digital transition, and of those Independent artists, collectives, labels, and sparse services who’ve been building an ark for all of us (not just the hipsters.) My bias is dense on this subject, but so are my expectations. I’ve distributed embedded audio players throughout the work which play exclusively (with only two exemptions) from a collection of music I would almost certainly have never discovered in a world without Bandcamp.

[ ] Yzome:  I guess it's something I take for granted. Like "thank god I don't have to look for a label to release this," and also it's seen as a legitimate platform (by people who might actually care about what I’m doing, at least), which I think is less offputting than uploading things to Mediafire or whatever else. It’s populist and boutique at the same time. but as for whether it's helped me, i don't know. i'm miserable at PR so i often wish i did have a label to release on but i've mostly been too stubborn to take that route and i don't think that does me any favors. but in like 2009 when i was trying to distribute my music at shows, i couldn't even pay most people to take a CD. that music was of a drastically lesser quality than what i do now so that's irrelevant, though, i think, but it's still the most relevant thing I have to compare it to. i've done releases through labels, also, and it's kind of maddening to not know what my exact numbers are at any given time. and i think it's stupid of me to feel that way. but now that i've had control i don't like relinquishing it, even though i'm not putting it to good use, myself.

    Most of the music on Spotify is played less than 1% of the time.
